Arena Game was a project designed to show off how certain things are done in Forge Remastered, showcased as a fully featured game since I figured that's the best way to example stuff. It's created by me, NFMynster, come for a chat on the Forge Discord server [here](https://github.com/BeardedManStudios/ForgeNetworkingRemastered) if you are interested in Forge or want to have a general chat with some nice people!


# Documentation & support!
> but why did you do this like that and that like this 

I'm still unsure whether or not I will be supporting this for eventual bugs, as it's more meant as a showcase product than a actual commercial/real title. That's also a reason why some of the systems are made the way they are, as they serve a better purpose of exampling stuff rather than being super optimal or ideal (such as cheatproofing)
Also, it should be noted that Forge doesn't have a uniform way of doings thing (*does programming really?*) so this is my network design and my way of doing things, and there certainly are things that get be improved. 
And because of that, I wrote a few articles in the Github Wiki for this project, explaning my main structure and why/how I did what I did.


# Credit

For making this a better example, I've used a few assets, as I'm no artist myself!

* [Kenney.nl](http://kenney.nl/) - For (almost) all 3d assets used in the game! 
    * more specifically the [weapons pack](http://kenney.nl/assets/weapon-pack), [the nature pack](http://kenney.nl/assets/nature-pack-extended), [the castle kit](http://kenney.nl/assets/castle-kit) and of course [the characters](http://kenney.nl/assets/3d-characters).

* [SimpleFX](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/67834) - Some very nice cartoony particle, where I modified some of them slightly.

* And of course the Forge Discord - Everything Forge related, question, answers and so on.

# Usage

ArenaGame is made with Unity 2017.2.0f3 using Forge 24.2.
It should work on other Unity installations try it out.
Just open up the project in Unity, open the /Scenes/MainMenu and press play, and you are good to go.
If you want to build it, make sure you make the main menu the first scene and the ArenaScene the second scene in the build menu. 
**There is also a compiled build included for Windows, if you just wanna have a quick test run**
